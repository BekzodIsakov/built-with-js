What I've learnt in this project

1. Connect google font via html vs css file - http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2009/04/09/dont-use-import/ ðŸ‘ˆ states that linking to the font in HTML is better for performance than importing into CSS.

2.HTML &gt;time&lt; element - The <time> tag defines a specific time (or datetime).

The datetime attribute of this element is used translate the time into a machine-readable format so that browsers can offer to add date reminders through the user's calendar, and search engines can produce smarter search results.
